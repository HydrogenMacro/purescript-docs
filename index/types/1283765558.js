If the input value is unused\n  (`Unit`), or irrelevant to the state construction, this will often be\n  `const ?someInitialStateValue`.\n- `render` is a function that accepts the component's current state and\n  produces a value to render (`HTML` usually). The rendered output can\n  raise actions that will be handled in `eval`.\n- `eval` is a function that handles the `HalogenQ` algebra that deals with\n  component lifecycle, handling actions, and responding to requests.\n","hashAnchor":"t","info":{"tag":"typeSynonym","value":{"arguments":[{"name":"state"},{"name":"query"},{"name":"action"},{"name":"slots"},{"name":"input"},{"name":"output"},{"name":"m"}],"type":{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Prim"],"Record"]},{"tag":"RCons","annotation":null,"contents":["\u0000i\u0000n\u0000i\u0000t\u0000i\u0000a\u0000l\u0000S\u0000t\u0000a\u0000t\u0000e",{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Prim"],"Function"]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"input"}]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"state"}]},{"tag":"RCons","annotation":null,"contents":["\u0000r\u0000e\u0000n\u0000d\u0000e\u0000r",{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Prim"],"Function"]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"state"}]},{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Halogen","HTML","Core"],"HTML"]},{"tag":"ParensInType","annotation":null,"contents":{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Halogen","Component"],"ComponentSlot"]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"slots"}]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"m"}]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"action"}]}}]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"action"}]}]},{"tag":"RCons","annotation":null,"contents":["\u0000e\u0000v\u0000a\u0000l",{"tag":"BinaryNoParensType","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeOp","annotation":null,"contents":[["Data","NaturalTransformation"],"~>"]},{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Halogen","Query","HalogenQ"],"HalogenQ"]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"query"}]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"action"}]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"input"}]},{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeApp","annotation":null,"contents":[{"tag":"TypeConstructor","annotation":null,"contents":[["Halogen","Query","HalogenM"],"HalogenM"]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"state"}]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"action"}]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"slots"}]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"output"}]},{"tag":"TypeVar","annotation":null,"contents":"m"}]}]},{"tag":"REmpty","annotation":null}]}]}]}]}}},"moduleName":"Halogen.Component","name":"ComponentSpec","packageInfo":{"tag":"package","value":"halogen"},"score":0,"sourceSpan":{"end":{"column":4,"line":83},"name":".spago\\p\\halogen-7.0.0\\src\\Halogen\\Component.purs","start":{"column":1,"line":79}}}]
